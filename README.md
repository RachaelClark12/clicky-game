# Clicky Game

## Technology
React: https://reactjs.org/

## Functionality
Clicky game tracks the player's score. The player's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The player's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the player's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
